## 1. IG-Style UI Designer Agent ðŸ“±âœ¨

### Purpose
Design visually engaging, student-focused interfaces with Instagram's visual aesthetic for academic tools.

### Agent Prompt
```
Design a visually engaging and highly usable UX/UI for a student-focused web application in the visual style of Instagram (IG). This app should feel sleek, mobile-first, and socially intuitive while supporting real academic tools like class schedules, assignments, shared resources, messaging, and dashboards.

Visual Style:
- Base design language inspired by Instagram (mobile-native design)
- Use smooth dark and light gradients, soft-glass effects, and sharp elevation layering
- Typography should mimic IG's aesthetic: clean sans-serif, spacious line height, and subtle font weights (e.g., Proxima Nova, SF Pro)
- Layouts should be scroll-friendly, interactive, and use story-style modular blocks for things like assignments, classes, or chats
- Spacing and sizing should reflect a mobile social feed (use cards, reels, tiles where relevant)

Design Goals:
- Mobile-first, but scale beautifully to tablet and desktop
- Highly responsive UI with simple, tappable components
- Modular blocks for quick updates and rich previews (like assignment tiles or course cards)
- Visual clarity and information grouping with subtle color play and soft shadows

Deliverables:
- Visual design rationale
- Wireframe-style layouts for dashboard, calendar, assignment preview, and messaging
- Suggested Tailwind-based implementation of components (if applicable)
- Text and UI spacing matching IG's content rhythm and aesthetic
```

### Key Features
- Instagram-inspired visual language
- Mobile-native design patterns
- Story-style modular components
- Social media UX patterns for academic tools
- Smooth gradients and glass morphism effects

### Usage Context
Use this agent when designing student-centric interfaces that need to feel familiar and engaging, particularly for academic social platforms, assignment management, or collaborative learning tools.

## ðŸ’» Frontend UI Agent
The Frontend UI agent is responsible for managing user interactions within the application. Its primary functions include:

- **Input Handling**: Captures user inputs for matrix calculations and equation solving. It ensures that the inputs are valid and provides real-time feedback to the user.
- **Result Display**: Formats and displays the results of calculations and solutions in a user-friendly manner. The UI agent updates the interface dynamically based on user actions.
- **User Guidance**: Offers tooltips and instructions to assist users in navigating the application. This includes hints for input formats and error messages for invalid entries.
- **State Management**: Handles application state, form validation, and user session management
- **Component Orchestration**: Manages React/Vue components, event handling, and DOM manipulation

## âš¡ Frontend Code Generation Agent

### Agent Prompt
"Generate a highly modular, scalable, and clean front-end code architecture for a student web app using [React + TypeScript] or [Next.js + Tailwind CSS]. The structure should follow modern best practices such as separation of concerns, reusable components, atomic design principles, and context or Redux for global state. Include directory structure, file naming conventions, sample components (like Header, DashboardCard, Sidebar, ScheduleItem), API integration examples, and state management strategy. The code should be easy for other developers to read, maintain, and extend. Assume multiple developers will collaborate on this project over time."
